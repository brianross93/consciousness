# Available Data Sources for Testing Quantum-Avalanche Predictions

## 1. Neural Avalanche Data (Direct Test)

### Beggs Lab / Criticality Data
**Source:** arXiv:2102.09124 - "Avalanche dynamics and correlations in neural systems"
**What it has:** 
- Power-law exponents (alpha ~1.5) from cortical slice recordings
- Avalanche size distributions
- Duration vs size scaling

**How to get it:**
- Contact John Beggs (Indiana University): jmbeggs@indiana.edu
- Some datasets on Figshare/Zenodo from criticality papers
- CRCNS (Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience): https://crcns.org/

**What we could test:**
- Compare real avalanche skewness to our quantum vs classical predictions
- Check if real data shows "clustered large events" pattern

### BrainScaleS / Human Brain Project
**Source:** https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/explore/data/
**What it has:**
- Large-scale neural recordings
- Some avalanche-tagged datasets

## 2. Xenon Isotope Data (Quantum-Specific Test!)

### **KEY PAPER: PMID 29642079**
**Citation:** Li, N. et al. (2018). "Nuclear spin attenuates the anesthetic potency of xenon isotopes in mice." *PNAS*

**What they found:**
- Different xenon isotopes (same chemistry, different nuclear spin) have DIFFERENT anesthetic potency
- Isotopes with nuclear spin are LESS potent anesthetics
- This is a **quantum-specific effect** — classical chemistry predicts identical effects

**Why this matters for us:**
- Nuclear spin is purely quantum mechanical
- If consciousness/anesthesia depends on spin, quantum effects ARE relevant
- This is experimental evidence that quantum properties affect neural function

**Data availability:**
- Supplementary materials in PNAS paper
- May need to contact authors for raw data

## 3. Microtubule Quantum Coherence Data

### Tryptophan Superradiance (2024)
**Citation:** PMID 38641327 - J Phys Chem
**What it has:**
- Fluorescence data from MT tryptophan networks
- Evidence of collective quantum behavior at warm temps

### Bandyopadhyay Resonance Data
**Source:** MDPI Information 2014
**What it has:**
- Microtubule resonance frequencies across scales
- "Triplet of triplets" pattern

**Contact:** Anirban Bandyopadhyay (NIMS Japan)

## 4. MRI Entanglement Signals

### Kerskens 2022
**Citation:** DOI 10.1088/2399-6528/ac94be
**What it has:**
- MRI-detected signals correlating with consciousness state
- Claims entanglement-like behavior

**Data availability:**
- Contact authors for raw MRI data
- Methodology is public — could attempt replication

## 5. Psychedelic fMRI Data (Indirect)

### Carhart-Harris Psilocybin Studies
**Citation:** PMID 22308440 (PNAS 2012)
**What it has:**
- fMRI during psilocybin administration
- Shows DECREASED activity with INCREASED experience

**Public datasets:**
- OpenNeuro: https://openneuro.org/ (search "psilocybin" or "psychedelic")
- Some Imperial College datasets are public

---

## 6. Anesthesia/Microtubule Data

### EpoB/Isoflurane Study (2024)
**Citation:** PMID 39147581 - eNeuro
**What it has:**
- Microtubule stabilizer (EpoB) affects anesthetic response
- Supports MT involvement in consciousness

- **Christian Kerskens** (MRI entanglement): Trinity College Dublin
- **Anirban Bandyopadhyay** (MT resonance): NIMS Japan

### 3. Reanalyze Existing Data
The xenon isotope paper is the **strongest existing evidence** that quantum effects matter for consciousness. We could:
- Digitize their dose-response curves
- Calculate whether isotope effects match quantum predictions
- Compare spin vs no-spin isotope anesthetic curves

## What Would Each Dataset Tell Us?

| Dataset | If Supports | If Contradicts |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Avalanche skewness** | Quantum selection produces distinct patterns | Classical noise sufficient |
| **Xenon isotopes** | Nuclear spin (quantum) affects consciousness | Only mass/chemistry matters |
| **MT coherence** | Quantum states persist in warm biology | Decoherence too fast |
| **MRI entanglement** | Non-classical brain correlations exist | Classical artifacts explain signals |

---

## Bottom Line

**The xenon isotope study (PMID 29642079) is the closest thing to a "smoking gun"** — it shows quantum properties (nuclear spin) affecting anesthetic potency. This is exactly the kind of quantum-specific effect our model predicts.

Neural avalanche data from Beggs lab would let us directly test our skewness predictions against real brain recordings.

Both are obtainable with some effort.
